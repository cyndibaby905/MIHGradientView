MIHGradientView
===============

UIView subclass which draws a axial color gradient as background. You can customize the gradient with the properties `startPoint`, `startColor`, `endPoint` and `endColor`.

How To Get Started
------------------

You either can drag & drop the `MIHGradientView.h` and `MIHGradientView.m` into your project or use CocoaPods to add the dependency. If you choose the drag & drop solution you have to link your application against the QuartzCore.framework.

For details on how to use the MIHGradientView have a look at the interface deceleration and read the comments.

What It Can Look In Production Use
----------------------------------

The following image shows an iOS application where MIHGradientView is used to create the background gradient.
